# 1. Time and Location

- Time: 10:10 - 12:00, Each Monday

- Location: Room 514, Teaching Building one

- Lecturer: Likan Zhan

# 2. Course Information

This class intends to provide a coherent view on the relation between language and the brain based on the multifold empirical data coming from different research fields: electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging data of the adult language system, neuroscientific data of the developmental language system, and data on the brain structure and its maturation in humans as well as in non-human primates.
