# 2. Course Information

Experimental psychology is part of the very core of the discipline of psychology. Whether your interest is in learning about animal or human behavior, pure theoretical questions or applied problems, research or practice with children or adults, you cannot correctly understand your material, investigate your questions, or apply your knowledge without a clear understanding and ability to use the principles and methods of experimental psychology. 

Therefore, this course should help you:

  a. Understand the rationale, strengths and limitations of the experimental method of gaining knowledge about mental and behavioral processes.
  b. Learn how to design experimental and non-experimental studies.
  c. Know how to use the various methods used in experimental psychology, including those for humans, both self-report and non self-report based.
