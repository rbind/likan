 Cognition is acquisition, storage, transformation, and use of knowledge. Neuroscience is the study of the structure and workings of the nervous system. Cognitive neuroscience, then, is the study of how cognitive processes can be explained by the structure and function of the brain. This course briefly introduces the structure and function of the nervous system, the techniques used to study the nervous systems, and the main cognitive functions supported by the nervous system, such as Sensation and Perception, Object Recognition, Attention, Action, Memory, Emotion, Language, Cognitive Control, Social Cognition etc.
