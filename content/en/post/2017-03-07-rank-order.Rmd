Adapted from duffymo's Stack Overflow [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2315601/understanding-the-order-function)

1. `rank` tells you what order the numbers are in,

```{r}
a <- c(4.1, 3.2, 6.1, 3.1)
rank(a)
````

2. `order` tells you how to get them in ascending order.
```{r}
order(a)
````
