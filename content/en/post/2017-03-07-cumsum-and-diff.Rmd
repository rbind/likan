`diff(x)` returns a vector of length `(length(x)-1)` which contains the difference between one element and the next in a vector x.

`cumsum(x)` returns a vector of length equal to the length of x containing the sum of the elements in x

```{r results = "hold"}
x <- c(1:10)
diff(x)
cumsum(x)
````

The combination of `cumsum` and `diff` leads to different results, depending on the order in which the functions are executed:

```{r results =  "hold"}
cumsum(diff(x))
diff(cumsum(x))
```
